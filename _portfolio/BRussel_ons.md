Excerpts from the [Biographical memories of John Bardeen](https://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/bardeen-john.pdf), which indicates Bardeen's beautiful  traits and his art of doing research. 


> Bardeen followed the Bell Labs tradition of forming study groups to learn about what had been accomplished. With new things to study and new concepts to help understanding, it was (still is) a very exciting time to be involved in research.  The close collaboration between experimentalists and theorists extended through all stages of the research, from the conception of the experiment to the analysis of the results. Most papers were authored jointly by an experimentalist and a theorist. John was also a truly generous man. He never hesitated to give others credit for their contributions to science.

> In addition to advising industry and government, Bardeen was generous with his time in giving talks to a remarkably broad spectrum of audiences eager to hear his views; these audiences ran the gamut from elementary-school children to meetings of medical societies. But throughout the two decades following BCS his central interest remained in physics, beginning with an authoritative review of BCS and its applications (written
with Bob Schrieffer in 1961), and including his study of the application of BCS theory to a number of superconducting phenomena.
