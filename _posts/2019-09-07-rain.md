 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember a time you enjoyed rain –  it merrily coming from a distant, bringing the smell of sand; trees dancing to its beat, kids escaping from their mother's clutch;  the bonding we feel with nature. I sometimes ask myself: <q>When did we miss this?</q> Today, in the backdrop of floods, land-slides, and other disasters, when rain comes, all I see is fear looming in each and every eyes; wondering of floods, abandoned homes, dear ones lost, .... <q>Where did we went wrong? Do we want to instill the same fear for the generations to come?</q> So, this is my brick! Welcome all.

Wolf and her.
-----
Stoic was she, with a gentle smile,
faced the storm, without complaint;
As enemies they met and stayed,
but with hearts for no hate. 


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing he, the Wolf, may kill her smile,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the Nature then shall lose her grace,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as enough is enough for the pain she had;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though parting for him is hard to bear.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet he ran in the woods, deeper and deeper,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still with a heart for no hate, 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deeper and deeper, to save her smile!
