               We are actively looking for research students to work with us. <a href="../images/lincoln_v3_ons.jpg">Self motivated</a>, <a href="../images/kalam_ons.jpg">Ambitious</a> and <a href="../images/wright_brothers_quote.jpg">Keen</a> students with a research interest towards signal processing or image processing or computer vision, or applied mathematics are welcome to join our SPAI group. We closely follow this philosophy: please read <a href="../files/SPAI_philosophy_ons.pdf">this</a>.   
              </p>   
              <p>
                 We usually consider research projects that require long-term involvement (at least one year).  BTP/MTP students from outside Core AI departments are typically selected from the pool of interns working with us sincerely for a substantial time (so as to get a good understanding about our projects, team, and working style), via an optimal decision based on bilateral matching. Apologies for not being able to individually respond to the numerous student emails enquiring about this.
              </p>

              LoR policy: Truth be told, my letter of recommendation does not have much value; so your depth and breadth of research publications should strongly support you!
