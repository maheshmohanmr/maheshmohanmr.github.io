  <h2>About me</h2>
</body></html>
Welcome all! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.iitkgp.ac.in/), [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). I am also an Affiliate Researcher at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), US. In the IIT Kharagpur, I lead a &#8220;<i>Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence (SPAI)</i>&#8221; group.
 Our [SPAI group](https://maheshmohanmr.github.io/publications/) performs research in the intersection of Signal Processing with AI and Computer Vision. 


Previously, I was a  Postdoctoral Researcher  in the [Coordinated Science Laboratory](https://csl.illinois.edu/), [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) US, where I was advised by [Prof. Narendra Ahuja](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/n-ahuja). My postdoc research lies at the intersection of  Signal Processing, Computer Vision and AI.



Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/), [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), where I was  advised by [Prof. A. N. Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/) in [Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/). My Ph.D. research lies at the intersection of Image Signal Processing, Computer Vision and AI (for details, please find my [dissertation](https://maheshmohanmr.github.io/files/phd_thesis_ons.pdf)). Prior to my Ph.D., I have completed Master's (M-Tech) in [Communication Engineering and Signal Processing](http://gectcr.ac.in/electronics-department/m-tech-ec/), advised by [Prof. Sheeba V. S.](http://gectcr.ac.in/about-us/principals-profile/), and Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering, both with honours. 

I grew up in Kerala, India, a place adorned with [lush hues of Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftrFhWrvcLo). I am a nature- and art-lover, and have an interest in Philosophy of Science  [(some excerpts here)](https://maheshmohanmr.github.io/portfolio/).
